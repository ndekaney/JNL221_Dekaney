			<h3>Backlogged Beyond Belief</h3>
			<!-- Add image below this comment -->
			<p>Over the past five years, the American immigration courts have suffered. The total number of backlogged cases, meaning the cases that have been <a href="https://thecourtmanager.org/articles/measuring-the-impacts-of-strategies-to-reduce-court-caseloads-and-backlogs/" target="_blank"> pending beyond an acceptable time frame</a>, skyrocketed to <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/reports/736/" target="_blank">	over 3 million</a> this past year. <br>

			<br> In 2023 alone, the courts saw an increase of nearly 3 ⁄ 4 of a million cases, which is 300,000 more than the second highest yearly increase. <br> </p>

			<p> <br> Susan B. Long, co-founder of <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/" target="_blank"> TRAC</a> (Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse) and an Associate Professor of Managerial Statistics at Syracuse University, cites the Covid-19 pandemic as a potential root cause for this hike in backlog. <br>

			<br> “There was a period during covid that everyone was virtually being turned away trying to cross the border,” Long said, “While this administration has recently been trying to get some legislation through that would give the president some powers to reduce that flow when it gets too large, congress has been in deadlock.” <br>

			<br> States like Massachusetts, Florida, and New Jersey have particularly struggled to manage their respective state backlogs, with at least 2,000 backlogged cases per 100,000 people each. <br>

			<br> However, when we look at the state-by-state backlog that doesn’t account for population, we find that Texas and Florida make up <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/reports/736/" target="_blank"> nearly 30%</a> of the entire nation's backlog, with both states recording nearly half a million cases, respectively. <br></p>

			<h3>The Fallout</h3>
			<p>The massive uptick in backlog has only brought more complications to the courts, the most pressing of them being the shortage of immigration attorneys. Five years ago, immigrants found <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/reports/736/" target="_blank">attorneys in 65%</a> of the pending cases. Today, that rate has dropped to just 30%. <br>

			<br> Unlike the criminal courts in this country, the civil immigration courts do not provide an attorney if an immigrant cannot afford one. And without one, “It's very difficult to file the paperwork required for the court to even hold this hearing on asylum. So they are often simply ordered removal without ever having their hearing in court,” Long said. <br>

			<br> Craig Nichols, an immigration law attorney and the founder of <a href="https://www.immigrationlawyersinsyracuse.com/" target="_blank">NicholsLaw</a>, also spoke to the ambitious task of being self represented in an asylum case. <br>

			<br> “There’s quite a few criteria that have to be met for a legitimate asylum case which is proving that you suffer from persecution if you were to return from your home country. People do succeed when they’re self represented, unfortunately procedurally they probably fail because they didn’t realize the kind of proof or the amount of proof that needed to be represented,” said Nichols.<br></p>

			<iframe title="Hawaii Shows the Highest Attorney Representation Percentage in 2023" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-IPTY5" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IPTY5/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; border: none;" height="536" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>

			<p><br> In terms of each state's attorney representation percentage, Hawaii is leading the charge with a little more than half of their cases being represented. With that being said, Hawaii also listed less than 1,000 total cases. The state with the second highest representation percentage, California, recorded well over a quarter of a million cases. <br>

			<br> Of the 28 states with documented representation percentages, only six saw rates of 40% or more.  <br>

			<br> The absence of so many attorneys means that an escalating amount of immigrants are either not having their cases heard at all, or, if they are, it’s without the proper knowledge of our country’s complex statutes.<br>

			<br> The fourteenth amendment of our constitution prohibits states from depriving “any person” of life, liberty or property without due process of law. The supreme court has held that this protection extends to all <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt14-S1-1/ALDE_00013743/" target="_blank">natural persons</a>, regardless of race, color, or citizenship. <br> 

			<br> Because of this backlog and in turn the sinking attorney representation, this country is failing to ensure that right of due process. <br>

			<br> Although attempts have been made to cut through some of the backlog and improve the efficiency of the courts, they have proved to be ineffective. <br>

			<br> “There’s been a number of initiatives that this administration has adopted to try and speed cases through,” Long said, “What happens there is that if there’s less time, the facts show that fewer and fewer immigrants get representation. While it might be possible to speed up the hearings, it’s at the cost of due process.” <br>

			<br> One of those initiatives is the Biden administration’s Dedicated Docket (DD) program which aimed to expedite family asylum cases along the southwest border. The initiative was announced in May of 2021 with a goal to issue decisions on these cases no more than 300 days after the initial hearing. <br> 

			<br> After a year and a half of the Dedicated Docket, TRAC <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/reports/704/" target="_blank">conducted an assessment</a> of the program and found that while over ¾ of the cases were completed within the time frame goal, only 34% found attorney representation. <br>

			<br> Additionally, because of the continued low representation figures, only ⅓ of the families were able to even successfully file the asylum application. This means that in roughly two-thirds of the cases no real hearing on the asylum claims took place. <br> 

			<br> TRAC’s findings culminated in the fact that a mere 7% of the 40,000 closed cases were granted asylum. If the government wants to make these asylum cases move quicker, it will come at the expense of their fairness. <br>

			<h3>What Can be Done?</h3>
			<p>There is no clear cut solution to the struggles found in the immigration courts. Previous attempts may have seen improvements in the closing speed of cases, but they continue to fail in upholding the constitutional values of this country. <br>  

			<br> A component that might reveal some valuable insight to solving this problem lies in the hands of the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR). The same systems that track whether a case is represented or not also record the specific attorney representing the case. <br> 

			<br> According to <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/reports/736/" target="_blank">TRAC</a>, the EOIR has refused to provide even anonymous data on these attorneys that would allow counts at both a national and a state-by-state level. <br>

			<br> Access to this data would enable TRAC to calculate the total number of immigration attorneys that are out there and whether or not the supply of those attorneys is growing at a similar rate to the number of immigrants who need representation. <br> 

			<br> Likewise, this data could answer questions about the caseload size for attorneys and more specifically, the effectiveness of programs like the Dedicated Docket on those caseload sizes.<br> 

			<br> Long says that TRAC has also had to file an increasing number of lawsuits to try and get ICE as well as Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to release basic data about these cases. Similarly to the EOIR, it’s not that this data doesn’t exist, but more so that these agencies are refusing to share them.<br> 

			<br> “To manage any kind of organization these days, there is a digital trail going on,” Long said, “Under the freedom of information act, it’s the public's right to be able to monitor what our government is doing.”
